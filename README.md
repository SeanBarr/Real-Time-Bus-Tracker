Project Title: 
Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

Description:
This is an example of real time bus tracking. This maps utilizes API navigation between the routes between the MIT and Harvard campuses. 
I have adapted the styling to view as satellite and added the MIT colors for the start route button. 

Future styling changes will be replacing the current marker.
