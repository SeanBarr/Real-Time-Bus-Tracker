Project Title: Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

Description: This is a Real Time Bus Tracking Map that marks the routes between both MIT and Harvard campuses. 
This project utilizes Navigation API. I have adapted the styling to view as satellite and added the MIT colors for the button. 

Future stlying changes will be replacing the current marker.
